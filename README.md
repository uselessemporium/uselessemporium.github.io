# The site for the Useless Emporium

This site contains both a blog and the comics, it uses a custom image reader.

It commits to the site when a push is done to the `main` branch.

The `dev` branch contains new components, the difference is that the actual content is in main.
 
 To run it, you need to:

 ```commandline
 npm run dev
 ```
